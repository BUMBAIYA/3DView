## Jar and Natives included in repo in Lib directory or Download [LWJGL2](https://legacy.lwjgl.org/download.php.html)

Version 2.9.3 of Light Weight Java Game Library has a modular design for build artifacts. For convenience you can use the LWJGL build configurator. There you can choose if you want to download a ZIP Bundle or if you want to use a build tool. You could also browse through the artifacts at the bottom of the configurator and download each artifact manually.
This tutorial was made with the LWJGL release version 3.1.5 and the modules for GLFW, OpenGL and STB.

After downloading LWJGL as ZIP bundle or by using your build tool you will have multiple *.jar files. The lwjgl artifact is the core module, the binding artifacts have a lwjgl-\<binding> naming scheme. Optionally you may also have differenct classifiers like sources for the source code, javadoc for the documentation or natives-\<platform> for the native library files
